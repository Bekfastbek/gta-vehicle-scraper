# ðŸš— GTA Vehicle Scraper

This project scrapes vehicle data from [GTA Base](https://www.gtabase.com) and extracts real-life car models based on GTA vehicles.  

It consists of two scrapers:  
1. **Vehicle Link Scraper** - Collects links to GTA V/Online vehicles.  
2. **Vehicle Model Scraper** - Extracts real-life models for each vehicle.  

## ðŸ“¦ Features  
âœ… Scrapes vehicle links from multiple pages  
âœ… Extracts real-life car models  
âœ… Saves results in `vehicles.json` and `vehicle_list.json`  
âœ… Uses **Playwright** for fast, headless browsing

python -m vehicle_scraper
```
